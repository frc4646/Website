            In 2022, the team was officially rebranded as Wildcard Robotics. Wildcard was ready to take a new rookie number, but with Team ASAP ready to be officially disbanded, Wildcard instead reached out to use number 4646 and continue the previous team's legacy. Whilst they didn't win any awards in 2022, they had an amazing season and more to come.

            <p class="norm-text">
            In 2013, Team 4646 started as Team ASAP in Des Moines, Iowa. They started off with a very successful rookie year, earning the Rookie All-Star Award, and the Highest Rookie Seed award. Before getting rebranded, Team ASAP recieved a variety of awards over the course of years and became a successful team.
