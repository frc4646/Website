# Wildcard Robotics Website
This repository contains the official website of FRC team 4646 Wildcard Robotics.  


## How do we edit the site?
We use [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/4646) to edit the site and then push it to github. We do this because Glitch allows us to edit live, keeping the official site active without issues, while we break whatever we want.
