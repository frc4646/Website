# Wildcard Robotics Website
**Proposed and prototyped by [RobertTBS](https://rbrt.us)**
This repository contains the official website of Robotics team Wildcard 4646.  
See our dev team at the bottom of the page

## How do we edit the site?
We use [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/4646) to edit the site and then push it to github. We do this because Glitch allows us to edit live, keeping the official site active without issues, while we break whatever we want.
